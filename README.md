## 💻 DAA: Design and Analysis of Algorithms

-----

### **Overview**

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of code implementations, theoretical notes, and analyses related to fundamental algorithms and data structures. It is intended for students, developers, and enthusiasts looking to study, practice, and understand the core principles of **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)**.

### **📁 Repository Structure**

The project is organized into directories based on major algorithmic paradigms or topics for easy navigation.

| Directory | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `sorting/` | Implementations of various **sorting algorithms** (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort). |
| `searching/` | Implementations of **searching algorithms** (e.g., Binary Search, hashing techniques). |
| `greedy/` | Solutions and implementations using the **Greedy approach** (e.g., Dijkstra's, Huffman Coding). |
| `dynamic_programming/` | Solutions and implementations using **Dynamic Programming** (e.g., Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence). |
| `divide_and_conquer/` | Algorithms solved using the **Divide and Conquer** paradigm (e.g., Matrix Multiplication). |
| `graph_algorithms/` | Implementations of graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms (e.g., BFS, DFS, Floyd-Warshall). |
| `complexity_analysis/` | Notes, tools, or examples focused on **time and space complexity analysis** ($O(n)$, $\Omega(n)$, $\Theta(n)$). |
| `data_structures/` | Implementations of core **Data Structures** (e.g., Linked Lists, Trees, Heaps, Tries). |

### **🚀 Getting Started**

To explore and run the algorithms, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OpBlair/DAA.git
    cd DAA
    ```
<!--
2.  **Navigate to a specific algorithm directory:**
    bash
    cd sorting/
    # or
    cd dynamic_programming/
    ```
-->
2.  **Run the implementation:**
      * *Note: Most implementations are likely in Python or C++. Adjust the command based on the file type.*
    <!-- end list -->
    ```bash
    # Example for Python:
    python3 quicksort.py
    ```
